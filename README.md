# 3D minecraft panda
This repository contains a 3D minecraft panda made using tinkercad, using only squares. 
### Why i made this.
I never tried making 3d items so i decided to settle on a pretty easy one. as i loved minecraft i decided to make a panda (also my fav animal). If it arrives in time. I'm gonn keep it on top of my birthday cake.
